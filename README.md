Project Overview

The project involves product sales forecasting from past sales through machine learning methods. The model, based on key variables such as advertising expenditure, promotion, and customer segmentation, gives crucial information to maximize marketing and improve sales performance.

Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Missing value handling, outlier detection, and feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Data distribution, correlation, and trend analysis.

Model Development: Developing a Random Forest model for precise sales forecasting.

Model Evaluation: Employing the right measures to make conclusions about performance and enhance accuracy.

Business Insights: Providing actionable suggestions based on model predictions.

Methodology

Data Collection & Cleaning:

Import historical sales data.

Deal with missing values and remove inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Detect dominant trends and patterns.

Investigate the effect of promotions, customer segments, and seasonality.

Feature Engineering:

Perform feature scaling.

Select relevant features to improve model performance.

Model Training & Evaluation:

Train a Random Forest model for sales prediction.

Test using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² scores.

Business Insights & Optimization:

Resolve results to optimize marketing efforts.

Suggest enhancements according to predictive trends.

Expected Outcome
